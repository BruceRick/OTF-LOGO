I do not own commercial licensing for any of these included images. Examples of these logos are the apple, penci, paintbrush, star and trillium. I offer no liability for this logo concept.

This was not commissioned by the OTF or any of the affiliated unions. This is strictly a hobby/past time piece. A t-shirt design has been included to show support for the OTF and affiliated unions. Under no circumstances should this be distributed commercially.
